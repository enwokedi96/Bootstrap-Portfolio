# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This repo contains my portfolio which details my educational background and experience. It is a redo of my portfolio utilizing bootstrap 4.3 in place of custom css. It contains the following sections (in order): coding projects(specifically frontend projects), skills (soft and hard), Resume, About me and various contact channels.

## Installation

Visit the live website [here](https://enwokedi96.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).

## Usage

The screenshot of the webpage can be visualised below: 

<img alt="webpage visuals" src="/assets/images/full-webpage.png" width=600/>

Top of the page provides navigation tools allowing user to easily access sections in the body and at the bottom, there is a return to top button.
A day-night toggler is available on the top-right side of the banner.
The 'position' property is also set to sticky for section titles, allowing user to easily track current section while perusing. 
The works in the 'coding-projects' section all link to other deployed repos and once clicked are opened in a new tab. 
In addition, my google doc CV was embedded in the 'resume' section and is easily readable by in-frame scrolling.

The general webpage is made responsive using bootstrap elements, especially for medium and small viewports.
