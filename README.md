# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This repo contains my portfolio which details my educational background and experience. It is a redo of my [previous portfolio](https://enwokedi96.github.io/enwokedi-s_portfolio/) utilizing bootstrap 4.3 in place of custom css. It contains the following sections (in order): coding projects(specifically frontend projects), skills (soft and hard), Resume, About me and various contact channels.

## Installation

Visit the live website [here](https://enwokedi96.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).

## Usage

The screenshot of the webpage can be visualised below: 

<img alt="webpage visuals" src="/assets/images/full-webpage-part-1.png" width=360/> <img alt="webpage visuals" src="/assets/images/full-webpage-part-2.png" width=360/>

Top of the page provides navigation tools allowing user to easily access sections in the body and at the bottom, there is a return to top button.
A day-night toggler is available on the bottom-right directly below the banner.
The 'sticky' property used for the previous section titles was not implemented in this portfolio version. 
The works in the 'resume' section all link to other deployed repos and once clicked are opened in a new tab. As promised, more projects have been added to the list.
In addition, my google doc CV was also embedded in the 'resume' section and is easily readable by in-frame scrolling.

The general webpage is made responsive using bootstrap elements for all viewports.
